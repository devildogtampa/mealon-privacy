    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide when creating an account, including your name, email address, and profile information. We also collect usage data, device information, and location data (with your permission) to improve your experience and provide relevant restaurant recommendations.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> We use Supabase as our backend service provider for user authentication and data storage. Your data is stored securely on their servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> For in-app subscriptions, we use Google Play's billing system which processes payment information according to Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to provide and improve our services, personalize your experience, communicate with you, process transactions, and ensure security. We will not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
