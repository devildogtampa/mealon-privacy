Google processes all payment information according to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. <strong>We do not store or have access to your credit card or payment information.</strong> We only receive confirmation of your subscription status to provide you with the appropriate tier features.</p>
    <h3>Apple App Store In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>For in-app subscriptions on iOS devices, we use Apple's In-App Purchase system. Apple processes all payment information according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. <strong>We do not store or have access to your credit card or payment information.</strong> We only receive confirmation of your subscription status to provide you with the appropriate tier features.</p>
